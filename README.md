"Atlantic Odyssey: Mapping the Winter Harbor Freeland Bunker's Journal (1871-1885)"
Delve into the pages of Freeland Bunker's journal, a detailed account of his life in Winter Harbor, Maine, from 1871 to 1885. Each entry offers a glimpse into Bunker's daily activities, cherished by our local historical society.

# Introduction
For 37 years, from 1845 to 1909, Freeland Bunker diligently wrote daily entries in his diaries, offering a rare glimpse into the daily routines of Winter Harbor residents during the 19th century. Dr. Todd Little-Siebold, a member of the history faculty at the College of the Atlantic, an Dr. Laurie Baker, with the helph of Winter Harbor Historical Society has led efforts to digitize these diaries with student assistance. These digitized scans have become primary source materials in his classroom. Students have summarized the diaries from 1876 to 1889, highlighting Mr. Bunkerâ€™s extensive travels and diverse engagements in business, fraternal organizations, and community governance. From journeys spanning Italy to Gouldsboro, Bunker utilized every available mode of transportation. His activities ranged from managing a significant coal distribution enterprise to engaging in casual fishing.

My project aims to map Bunker's journey over the years, highlighting significant events such as his memorable Atlantic voyage. Through the use of coding tools like R and GIS, alongside HTML and Mapbox GL JavaScript, I'm creating an interactive platform. Here, users can seamlessly explore Bunker's experiences and Winter Harbor's rich history.
