            <h1>"Atlantic Odyssey: Mapping the Winter Harbor Freeland Bunker's Journal (1871-1885)"</h1>
            <h3>By: Muhammad Ilham AR Santoso</h3>
            <p>
                Delve into the pages of Freeland Bunker's journal, a detailed account of his life in Winter Harbor, Maine, from 1871 to 1885. Each entry offers a glimpse into Bunker's daily activities, cherished by our local historical society.
                Dr. Todd Little-Siebold, a member of the history faculty at the College of the Atlantic, and Dr. Laurie Baker, with the help of the Winter Harbor Historical Society, have led efforts to digitize these diaries with student 
                assistance: Gwendolyn Elkin, Michael Feng, Hannah Frink, Camden Hunt, Olivia Jolley, Adele Wise, and Tristan Lewis. These digitized scans have become primary source materials in his classroom. Students have summarized the diaries from 1876 to 1889, highlighting Mr. 
                Bunker’s extensive travels and diverse engagements in business, fraternal organizations, and community governance. </p>
            <p>
                My project aims to map Bunker's journey over the years, highlighting significant events such as his memorable Atlantic voyage. Through the use of coding tools like R and GIS, alongside HTML and Mapbox GL JavaScript, I'm creating an interactive platform. Here, users can seamlessly explore Bunker's experiences and Winter Harbor's rich history.

            <h3>by Muhammad Ilham AR Santoso</h3>
            <p>
                The journal begins in the year 1871-1872, marking a significant turning point in Freeland Bunker's life. 
                That year, he married the love of his life, and together they embarked on a new chapter in the quaint coastal town of Winter Harbor.
                Despite not traveling extensively, Freeland's journal entries are concise in descriptions of his experiences and the places he visited.  
                chronicling the beginning of his professional journey with various meetings and the meaningful work he engaged in.
                As time passed, Freeland's journal continued to capture the essence of his life in Winter Harbor. 
                He detailed the people he met, the ideas they exchanged, and the impact of his work on the community. 
                The pages reflect a man simple thought connected to his surroundings, finding solace in the town's day to day lifestyles. 
                Through his narrative, eventhough Freeland did not painted a vivid picture of his dedication to personal and professional growth, it feels like 
                he is leaving a legacy of his journeys.

            <h2>1873-1875</h2>
            <h3>by Muhammad Ilham AR Santoso</h3>
            <p>
                In the years 1873-1874, Freeland Bunker embarked on a grander journey, setting his sights on exploring the vast expanses
                of the northeastern ocean. This period marked a significant shift in his life as he transitioned from the familiar
                confines of Winter Harbor to the broader, more adventurous realms of maritime exploration. Freeland's travels took him
                from one island to another, each stop a new chapter in his expanding narrative. His journals from this time are filled
                with vivid descriptions of the rugged coastlines, the unpredictable seas, and the diverse communities he encountered
                along the way. Each island offered new landscapes, cultures, and opportunities, providing Freeland with a wealth of
                experiences that enriched his understanding of the region and its people.
                
                As he navigated the waters around Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, Freeland's relationships grew alongside his
                geographical explorations. He forged connections with fishermen, traders, and local leaders, each interaction adding to
                his network and deepening his ties to the maritime community. His entries from this period reflect a man in constant
                motion, driven by curiosity and a desire to build lasting bonds. The friendships he cultivated and the knowledge he
                gained during these journeys not only broadened his personal horizons but also contributed to the interconnectedness of
                the coastal towns and islands. Through his adventures, Freeland became a vital link in the chain of communication and
                commerce that stretched along the northeastern seaboard, leaving a lasting impact on the region he so passionately
                explored.

                The journal begins in the Mediterranean. Freeland was voyaging around the Mediterranean, along the coasts of France,
                Spain, and Italy from January 1st until the 22nd, when he jams his fingers. For the next seven days, he tries to
                continue to work despite having to get his fingers “done up” regularly. On January 30th, he goes into the Hospital to
                stay. He is in the Hospital for a few weeks. On the 17th of February, his finger had to be taken off just below the
                joint. On the 28th, he was able to leave the hospital and board his vessel.
                On March 1st, he went over land to visit the leaning tower of Pisa. March 4th is the day that they sail off from
                Leghorn, Italy, for New York. It takes them 16 days to pass the Rock of Gibraltar. They arrive in New York 44 days
                later, on May 3rd. During his stay in New York, he seems to mainly be sending and receiving letters.
                On May 13th, Freeland boarded another boat as mate. By May 20th, they went to sea bound for Cape Haiti. They arrive on
                June 4th. They then sail for Baracoa, Cuba, leaving June 10th and arriving the next day. On July 2nd, they load 366
                bunches of bananas onto the boat. They leave, bound for New York, two days later. They arrive back in New York on July
                17th.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freeland then leaves on the 27th, passing Fire Island and getting as far as Sandy Hook. The next day they anchored in
                Vineyard Haven. They arrive in Boothbay on August 1st. On August 3rd he takes a steamer home from Rockland.
                The day after he arrives home he is immediately helping J. I. Kingsley with hay. He attends a wharf meeting (8/5) and a
                district meeting (8/7) and begins working in his shop regularly. On August 10th he goes out on a steamer for an
                excursion in Somes Sound. He visits Turtle Island on the 26th to get fish from someone.
                On October 2nd he receives summons from Ellsworth to serve in the jury. He leaves on October 9th, and spends 10 days on
                a series of cases. Once he returns, he begins to go out gunning for birds a few times.
                On November 19th, he goes to Rockland to buy coal and provisions, and ends up buying Crow Island in an auction. He
                returns from Rockland on the 25th. F
                our days later, he and his wife take a steamer to Southwest Harbor, then a boat to Northwest Harbor. They visited
                Captain Thomas Bunker on the Cranberry Isles on the 30th, then take a steamer home to Sullivan on the 6th of December.
                He does go clamming one time, on December 13th. <br>

            <h3>by Michael Feng</h3>
            <p>
                March unfolds with a mix of sorrow and activity. On the 23rd, the lonely passing of Mrs. Nathean Hammond marks a somber
                moment in the journal's pages. Yet, just six days later, the tone shifts as a horse is acquired from George Westcott,
                injecting a note of life amid the mournful. April sees a journey to Brieh Harbor for Charles Grane's funeral,
                underscoring the communal bonds of grief and support.<br>
                
                Amidst the narrative, the journal reveals intriguing patterns and snippets of daily life. Entries commence with
                meticulous meteorological observations, detailing wind direction and temperature fluctuations before delving into the
                day's events. From heavy snowfall on January 10th and 11th to the simple pleasure of a "very pleasant" January 13th,
                each day unfolds with its own rhythm. Correspondence weaves through the narrative, from writing letters on January 17th
                to receiving them on January 19th, adding depth to the interpersonal tapestry. Meanwhile, professional and social
                engagements, such as registering as a Justice of Peace on February 26th or hosting dancing gatherings on January 28th,
                provide glimpses into a life both structured and dynamic.

            <h3>by Hannah Frink</h3>
            <p>
                This year consisted of writing many letters, going on sleigh trips, 
                selling sewing machine casters in Bar Harbor, and boat trips to surrounding towns/islands. 
                I am not sure if the letters were strictly to people Bunker was in business with, or if they are also to friends. 
                He wrote and read letters almost every other day. For example, he notes that on January 11th he read a letter from Stephen Southand. 
                Why does he need to remember that? To ensure that he writes a correspondence? The journal starts and ends with sleigh conditions, 
                which I’m assuming he needed to be aware of in order to haul merchandise to and from his store with 
                (January 5th, sleighing conditions are over on March 23rd). 
                Sewing machine casters seemed to be a prominent object to sell and I wonder why in Bar Harbor specifically 
                (April 10th & 22nd to 24th). Did Bunker sell whatever was in high demand or was there a specific market he operated from? 
                1879 was a year of continued boat trips, I’m assuming on the same routes he has been traveling on for years. 
                He often travels on the mail route to bring items out to sell. <br>
            </p>
 
            <p>
                While Bunker’s life revolves around several daily boat trips, 
                he also is involved in seasonal activities and social events. 
                In the winter he is fishing, hauling wood (February), and practicing wood carving, 
                while in May he finds pride in his farming. I enjoyed reading about his potato patch, 
                from seed to a several bushel harvest. He is involved in at least two Masonic lodges, 
                although I’m not sure if Eureka is a Masonic lodge. It seems like he meets up with clients at the lodge. 
                He also participates in elections and mock court several times throughout the year, as he did in Birch Harbor on January 29th. <br>

            <p>
                The beginning of January seems to be consumed with Bunker delivering mail. He has moments where he interacts with
                specific people in the community and goes to religious meetings–he also focuses heavily on when he writes to someone or
                receives a letter, which he does often.
                In February, Bunker spends a good deal of time gathering firewood. Other than that, he is very brief. He spends time
                working for other people, often N.A. Bickford, but does not specify what that work entails. He continues to attend
                religious meetings
                In March, he continues to work in an undescribed way, still with N.A. Bickford. I’ve noticed the fish house is mentioned
                only briefly in specific places, which leads me to wonder how much information we’re missing. He mentions working on
                boats (specifically skiffs), and continues to detail religious meetings and writing letters.
                In April, he works a good deal with his own boat and other people’s. This seems to include aspects of building and
                repairing. He also works with docks and on the water almost every day. He continues the regular activities.
                In May, Bunker begins to go out fishing. Basically the entirety of this month is details on weather and fishing.
                In June, Bunker begins farming and gardening with little detail as to what he is farming or gardening. He continues to
                fish and work on people’s boats, as well as do unknown work for several people. He continues to note the letters he
                writes.
            </p>
            <p>
                In July, he basically does the same thing as June. He notes his work on a sail, which adds some dimension to his
                previous comments about working on boats. I’m wondering if the religious meetings he often attends are still
                happening–he has stopped mentioning. Maybe he considers fishing more important.
                In August, he discusses almost only fishing. See above three months.
                In September, he continues to mention everything from the past four months. He places a little more emphasis on building
                boats, but not a ton more.
                In October, he continues to fish and farm, but seems to be at least a little focused on preparation for the winter–he
                gathers potatoes and treats some fish. He continues to give little outside of that information.
                In November, he continues winter preparation, marked by multiple instances of salting fish. He begins to do more work a
                la boat building/repairing or wagon repairing, likely so these vehicles can last through the winter.
                In December, Bunker travels downeast and spends time in Lubec and Eastport. He spends time working with herring catches
                and finishes out the year loading frozen herring.

            <h2>1881</h2>
            <h3>by Olivia Jolley</h3>
            <p>
                For January and February, Bunker was very much sticking to land and doing work in Winter Harbor. Starting in March, even
                with the weather seeming to still be cold winter storms, he ventured out onto the water and started going on trips near
                and far to transport goods. He went to a variety of places in Maine but even went as far as Boston, Massachusetts, and
                New York. These voyages continued almost nonstop until they slowed down in October. Bunker makes his first mention of
                his wife on September 3rd. I almost forgot he had a wife until that reminder. I was surprised by how much time he spent
                consistently on the water after these voyages began; I was expecting him to be going out for a few weeks before
                returning home and spending some time in Winter Harbor before heading back out to sea, not get home in the evening and
                then head out to a new place the very next morning. It was a useful reminder that when you work on the water, your work
                days are dictated by the waves and the water, not a schedule removed from what’s going on in the world around you. The
                number of places he references on some of these days also surprised me, but the fact that he made sure to note those
                places when he passed by them conveyed to me the importance of familiarity with place. He wasn’t stopping at all of
                these places each time, but just passing by them was important enough to note in the few sentences he could fit in his
                daily journals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The stories that seemed to interest me the most were those of the evening event mentioned multiple times--the Lyceum
                Question--and some of the mentions of legal proceedings scattered throughout. I’m curious if the Lyceum Question only
                included people from Winter Harbor or if it was an event that drew a crowd from nearby, too. The event is mentioned on
                January 18th, January 25th, and February 5th and the philosophical discussions that Bunker briefly addresses seem like
                the kinds of topics that would appear in a university classroom. I wonder if the people in attendance viewed these
                discussions like an informal higher education. The legal story that stuck in my head was the one mentioned on February
                15th where Bunker was preparing to defend someone in court: “Emma Sargent alleges that Herbert Tracy promised to marry
                her and sues him for breach of promise. Damages to the amount of $40,000. Verdict -- guilty.” That story raises so many
                questions. How could you prove a breach of promise? Did Bunker know both of these people? Were either of them from away?
                Did he have a choice in defending Herbert Tracy? Was $40,000 at that time an appropriate amount for damages? What kind
                of damages would that account for?
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also very interested in the work Bunker did outside of things related to the water and how, in a roundabout way,
                that illustrates his connection to the sea. In addition to activities that seem to be community expectations like
                shoveling the highway and attending town meetings, his legal activities such as writing deeds and mortgages seem to
                speak to a trend I’ve been exposed to through this course and previous courses: Mainers don’t usually rely on one source
                of income. Not only does Bunker have this intellectual life going to Lyceum Question evenings and maneuvering legal
                documents and duties, but he seems to choose being at sea over staying home. I’m not sure if it’s because transporting
                goods was where the money was at, but the sentimental side of me likes to think it can partially be attributed to the
                draw of sailing life and the desire to be on the water. Having grown up with this idea from academia that being an
                educated and well-known person is the ideal people to strive for, the fact that Bunker belonged to two very different
                professions that are associated with two very different sets of values and lifestyles stands out to me in particular.
                This train of thought relates back to what Diana was saying about older fishermen looking down on themselves because
                they feel like their profession is lesser and that they cannot be as intelligent as someone like a lawyer. Just from
                reading a couple sentences a day from a year of Bunker’s life, I’m amazed at how much he knows.

                During the year of 1883, Bunker started off the year in New York travelling up the coast and dealing with multiple
                weather delays and waiting for the ice to melt. Finally returning back to Winter Harbor in late January, Bunker helps to
                break the ice in the harbor to help vessels move. His vessel is named Chromo. Throughout the year, while in Winter
                Harbor (which he refers to as “home”) he mentions attending the lyceum, which was held at the town hall. In February,
                Bunker gives the first mention of his wife. On the 12th of February, Bunker noted that the barn and house of a man named
                Henry Sarguet was burned. Not much more was mentioned, other than that the furniture was saved.
            </p>
            <p>
                While back in Winter Harbor in early March, Bunker recorded doing some boat maintenance such as painting. On March
                twenty-fifth he notes that his tooth had been broken off by his Doctor who was trying to extrude it. No further notes
                were made on this. On April 9th, the first mention of loading stones appears. On the fourteenth he records that his
                vessel carrying rocks hit some rocks with “great force” which resulted in water to enter the vessel. The following weeks
                Bunker records the troubleshooting, waiting and reshipping the load onto another vessel. On April 23rd he reports going
                ashore to attend a “Negro Jubilee Concert comprised of singing.” Ultimately on April 24th, Seth Ann is the vessel that
                ends up taking the load for reshipping. After the majority of the load is transferred to the Seth Ann, surveys are taken
                to determine the damage on the original boat.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 5th Bunker and the crew were advised to work on the keel in Rockland railway station. These repairs continue
                until the eighth of May. On the 14th of May, Bunker records continuing to load stones, as well as receives notice that
                someone has died. The following day, he attends the funeral with his wife and mentions that his wife will traveling to
                Philedelphia, leaving their daughter at the grandmothers house. Bunker leaves soon after that, travelling to Port
                Richmond, having to wait a few days to unload. Returning back home with his wife on June 19. On June 28th he attended a
                travelling exhibition at the hall in winter harbor along with his wife and daughter. While traveling down near Vineyard,
                he reported going on shore on July 4th, but reported “nothing of importance was going on.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of July, August, and September consist of trips back and forth down the coast with loads of stone. On October 17th,
                Bunker records travelling to a lake to search for the bodies of a captain A. L Mitchell from Milbridge and another boy
                who had drowned. The captains body was recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                On November 29th he acknowledges the holiday with by saying “Thanksgiving.” In December Bunker attends a sociable at the
                hall with his family which was intended to raise money for a graveyard fence. The next day on the 20th he travels to
                Gouldsboro to a Sardine Factory for a town meeting. Throughout the year he mentions attending Lycuem’s in the Winter
                harbor hall. They all begin with Question Resolved, and followed with: that it was better for the people of the US to
                have the property equally divided, there be no restrictions in voting on account of self, that a single man can live a
                happier live than a married man, and holding sociables is a greater evil to the community than dancing.

                Bunker’s begins in early January at his home in Winter Harbor. Each entry starts with the wind direction and or brief
                description of the weather. This is the case even on days when Bunker is not on the Water. On January 14, Bunker writes:
                “Went to the town Harbor after a stick for a flying jibboom for (Seh A. G. Brooks)” On this day, the wind was southwest,
                free of snow. For the next few days, Bunker’s journal entries are filled with mentions of the jibboom: Jan 20, “Worked
                most all day for J.H. (smalleagle) on flying jibboom”. Jan 21, “Finished jibboom for A.G. Brooks”. Throughout the Winter
                much of Bunker’s entries involve prep work and up-rigging, on his ship the “Chrono”. On March 14, Bunker writes: “Made
                fenders in shop for Chrono”. March 26: “Worked on Chrono all day”. On April 2, Bunker eventually sets sail, and heads
                for West Sullivan. On May 13, Bunker again writes about finding a “stick” for a jibboom. For the next several days,
                until May 27, Bunker works on making and rigging the jibboom. From here on out most of Bunker’s entries include weather
                descriptions and port locations as he sails along the North East coast, discharging goods such as coal. On May 30th,
                Bunker writes about reaching Gloucester. On June 10th, He reaches Philadelphia. After this, Bunker sails back up to
                Maine. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On June 21, he went to a singing concert at the meeting house in Kennebunkport.
                On July 4th, Bunker gets ready to go back to Philadelphia again. He writes about celebrating the holiday, but also
                loading and securing heavy rocks to the “Chrono” in order to prepare for heavy weather. On July 20th, Bunker reaches the
                Philada river and complains about the temperature reaching 100 degrees. He continues to mention the heat the following
                day as he waits for the discharge of goods at Philadelphia Wharf. On July 28, Bunker leaves again for Kennebunkport. He
                arrives on August 11th and discharges coal. On september 2nd, Bunker writes about working on “Chrono” all day in
                Ellsworth harbor. On September 12th, Bunker leaves Winter Harbor again, this time for Washington DC. On October 29,
                Bunker writes: “40 years old today”. From here, Bunker stays at home for a couple weeks, and then leaves for New York on
                Nov. 16th. On November 27th, Bunker goes to a meeting with the Salvation Army in Salem. On December 15th, he arrives in
                New York. Finally on christmas day Bunker is in New Jersey waiting to load a shipment of coal, but is frustrated because
                no one is working during the holiday. The last couple entries of the journal are spent complaining about this delay. On
                December 28th, Bunker finally gets the coal shipment.
